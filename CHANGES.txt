* Added `News Item` to the list of `purgedContentTypes`, so the image field
  and its scales gets purged.

* Associated `file_view`, `image_view` and `image_view_fullscreen` by default
  with the `plone.content.itemView` ruleset, since none of them is the default
  view of their respective content type, they didn't get the automated
  handling.
