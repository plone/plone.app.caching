  [hannosch]

  [esteele]


1.0.2 (2012-04-15)
------------------
- Handle caching of resource registries in RAM cache by not storing empty
  bodies in the RAMCache
  [eleddy with major tseaver support]


1.0.1 (2012-01-26)
------------------
- Properly handle a changed configuration from with etags to no etags by
  forcing a page refresh
  [eleddy]

- When not caching with etags, don't sent an etag header to stop caching
  [eleddy]

- When there was an error like Unauthorized, 200 status and empty body would be
  cached in RAMCache instead of not caching anything.
  This is due to a bug with Zope 2.13 publication events :
  response.status is not set when IPubBeforeAbort is notified.
  Fixed by using error_status stored on request by plone.transformchain.
  [gotcha]

- Added 12 translation strings for ruleset's title and description. Corresponding translation
  strings have been added in plone.app.caching-manual.pot in PloneTranslations
  [giacomos]

- Added 6 translation strings for caching profiles' title and description. Corresponding translation
  strings have been added in plone.app.caching-manual.pot in PloneTranslations
  [giacomos]

- Changed wrong i18n domain in the messagefactory. plone.caching -> plone.app.caching.
  [giacomos]

1.0 - 2011-05-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use the `userLanguage` ETag component in place of the language ETag component
  in the default configs to allow ETags to be used for anonymous users with
  caching.
  [elro]

  [elro]

  included in the response headers.
  [davisagli]

  would otherwise take precedence.
  [stefan]


1.0b2 - 2011-02-10
------------------

- Added `News Item` to the list of `purgedContentTypes`, so the image field
  and its scales gets purged.
  [stefan, hannosch]

- Associated `file_view`, `image_view` and `image_view_fullscreen` by default
  with the `plone.content.itemView` ruleset, since none of them is the default
  view of their respective content type, they didn't get the automated
  handling.
  [stefan, hannosch]

- Added purging for plone.app.blob's BlobFields.
  [stefan, hannosch]

- Fix documentation to refer to the correct `resourceRegistries` instead of
  the singular version.
  [stefan, hannosch]

- Use plone.registry ``FieldRefs`` to manage parameter overrides. This
  requires plone.app.registry 1.0b3 and plone.app.registry 1.0b3 or later.
  [optilude]

- Update distribution metadata to current best practice.
  [hannosch]

- Added an etag component to track the existence of a copy/cut cookie
