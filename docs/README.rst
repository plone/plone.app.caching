plone.app.caching
=================


Introduction
============

``plone.app.caching`` provides a Plone UI and default rules for managing HTTP response caching in Plone. It builds on ``z3c.caching``, ``plone.caching`` and ``plone.cachepurging``.

``plone.app.caching`` requires Plone 4 or later.


Installation
============

From Plone 4.1 onwards, ``plone.app.caching`` is shipped as a dependency of Plone. It is available from the Control Panel, but not enabled by default. You can enable it from the "add-ons" menu option.

Installation on Plone 4.0
=========================

To install ``plone.app.caching``, add it to the ``eggs`` list in your ``buildout.cfg``, or as a dependency of one of your own packages in ``setup.py``. ZCML configuration will be automatically loaded via a ``z3c.autoinclude`` entry point. You will also need to install the package in Plone's Add-ons control panel as normal.

This package depends on a number of other packages, including ``z3c.form`` and ``plone.app.registry``, that do not ship with Plone.
You will probably want to lock down the versions for those packages using a known good set. Add this to the the ``extends`` line in your ``buildout.cfg``, *after* the line that includes the Plone KGS::

    extends =
        ...

Update the version number at the end of the URL as appropriate. You can find an overview of the versions
